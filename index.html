Only the finest materials are used in their furniture. They employ inspectors that ensure technically-sound components and design throughout the process. These experts oversee production, checking in at key transaction points so that nothing is overlooked. Before an item is packaged, it is reviewed with a keen eye and must pass a comprehensive checklist by our quality control inspector.\nFrance and Son is an authorized seller of this product."}, {"id": 7051825250349, "name": "Shay Chair", "retail_price": 465.0, "image_urls": ["https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2645/6534/files/DIN00070_1-1.jpg?v=1749270128", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2645/6534/files/DIN00070-1.jpg?v=1749270126", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2645/6534/files/DIN00070_2-1.jpg?v=1722351885", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2645/6534/files/DIN00070_3-1.jpg?v=1722351885", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2645/6534/products/DIN00082_1-1.jpg?v=1749270125", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2645/6534/files/DIN00082_1-1.png?v=1753910148", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2645/6534/products/DIN00082-1.jpg?v=1749270120", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2645/6534/products/DIN00082_2-1.jpg?v=1749270117", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2645/6534/products/DIN00082_5-1.jpg?v=1749270118"], "description": "Dimensions:33\" H X 18.5\" W X 20.5\" D\nWeight: 22 lbs\n\nFinish\n\nAntique Brass, Granite\nAntique Brass, Off White\n\n\nMaterial: Mild Steel, Upholstery\n\nInspired by mid-century details with a hint of Art Deco, our Shay chair is upholstered in cotton dhurrie fabric and supported by antique brass plated legs.
